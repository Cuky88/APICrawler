## APICrawler, Text Mining & Clustering
This document is describing the software and tools used for our work “From textual to structured Web API Descriptions” in the course of the seminar “Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 2017” at KIT. It is also a step-by-step guidance how to setup and use the software.

## Download, Installation and Usage
Please refere to the [Wiki](../../wiki/1.Start) and make sure, that you read everything carefully. Every step and every other solutions we tried, are described in there.

## Final dataset
The final dataset with every information from Programmable Web, the URL checking, links found from Google and the corresponding website contents can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6pePF5DAf_hU0NhN3BpSmN1Tlk).
<br><br>
In the api_docs folder is also a file called progweb_final_filtered.json, which only holds the data from Programmable Web with the URL checking results. This is the final version from Programmable Web. You can also download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6pePF5DAf_hZkhxWVZVcjFPMEU).

## Manually Clustered API
