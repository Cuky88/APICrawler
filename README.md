# APICrawler
Scrapy crawler for querying google search and crawling api documentation for text mining

# Final dataset
The final dataset with every information from programmableweb, the link checking, links found from google and the corresponding website contents can be found in this file:<br>
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6pePF5DAf_hU0NhN3BpSmN1Tlk
<br><br>
In the api_docs folder is also a file called progweb_final_filtered.json, which only holds the data from programmableweb with the link checking results.
